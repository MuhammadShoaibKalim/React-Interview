# Top 40 React Interview Questions with Answers and Examples

This repository contains the top 40 React interview questions with detailed explanations and examples to help you ace your next interview.

## Questions and Answers

1. **What is React?**
   - React is a JavaScript library used to build user interfaces, especially for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components.
   - Example: React components return JSX which renders UI elements.
   ```js
   function Welcome(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. **What is useMemo?**
   - `useMemo` is a React Hook that memorizes the result of a function and only recalculates it when one of its dependencies changes. This can help improve performance by preventing unnecessary recalculations.
   ```js
   const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
   ```

3. **What are the features of React?**
   - **JSX**: A syntax extension for writing HTML-like elements in JavaScript.
   - **Components**: Reusable building blocks for UI.
   - **Virtual DOM**: Efficient re-rendering by comparing virtual and actual DOM.
   - **One-way data binding**: Ensures data flows in a single direction.
   - **Performance**: Optimized for high-performance rendering.

4. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX stands for JavaScript XML. It allows you to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM.
   ```js
   const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
   ```

5. **What is DOM?**
   - DOM (Document Object Model) is an interface that represents the structure of a webpage as nodes and objects.

6. **What is Virtual DOM?**
   - Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM. React uses it to improve performance by only updating the necessary parts of the DOM.

7. **What is the component life cycle of React class components?**
   - The lifecycle of a React component is split into Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting phases. Methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` correspond to these phases.

8. **What are fragments in React?**
   - Fragments allow you to return multiple elements from a component without adding extra nodes to the DOM.
   ```js
   return (
     <React.Fragment>
       <h1>Hello</h1>
       <p>World</p>
     </React.Fragment>
   );
   ```

9. **What are props in React?**
   - Props are inputs passed to components. They are used to pass data from parent to child components.

10. **What are synthetic events in React?**
    - Synthetic events are React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event system.

11. **What is the difference between Package.json and Package.lock.json?**
    - `package.json` defines project dependencies, while `package-lock.json` records the exact version of installed dependencies.

12. **What are the differences between client-side and server-side rendering?**
    - **Client-side rendering**: Happens in the browser and is faster for users after the initial load. It's better for rich client interactions.
    - **Server-side rendering**: Renders pages on the server and sends fully formed HTML to the browser, which improves performance and SEO.

13. **What is state in React?**
    - State is an object that determines how a component renders and behaves. Unlike props, state is local to the component and can change over time.

14. **What are props?**
    - Props (short for properties) are read-only inputs passed to a component from its parent.

15. **What are the differences between State and Props in React?**
    - **Props** are passed from parent to child components and are immutable.
    - **State** is local to the component and can be changed with `setState`.

16. **What is props drilling?**
    - Props drilling refers to passing props through multiple levels of components just to reach a deeply nested component.

17. **What are the disadvantages of props drilling, and how can we avoid props drilling?**
    - **Disadvantages**: It can lead to complex, unmanageable code.
    - **Solution**: Use the React Context API or state management libraries like Redux.

18. **What are Pure components in React?**
    - Pure components are components that only re-render when their props or state change.

19. **What are refs in React?**
    - Refs are used to access DOM elements directly and bypass React’s re-rendering process.

20. **What is meant by forward ref?**
    - Forward refs allow passing refs through a component to a child component.

21. **What are Error boundaries?**
    - Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application.

22. **What are Higher-order components in React?**
    - A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOCs are used to reuse component logic.

23. **What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?**
    - **Controlled components**: Components where form data is handled by the component’s state.
    - **Uncontrolled components**: Form data is handled by the DOM itself.

24. **What is useCallback?**
    - `useCallback` is a hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It helps avoid recreating the same function during re-renders.

25. **What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback?**
    - `useMemo` memoizes a computed value, whereas `useCallback` memoizes a function.

26. **What are keys in React?**
    - Keys are used in React to identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, helping optimize rendering.

27. **What is Lazy loading in React?**
    - Lazy loading allows components to be loaded on demand, reducing initial load time.

28. **What is suspense in React?**
    - Suspense is a component that allows for lazy loading of components by delaying the rendering of a component until some condition is met.

29. **What are custom hooks?**
    - Custom hooks allow you to reuse logic across multiple components.

30. **What is the useReducer hook?**
    - `useReducer` is a hook used for complex state logic in components. It returns the current state and a dispatch method.

31. **What are Portals in React?**
    - Portals allow rendering a component’s children into a DOM node outside of the parent component’s DOM hierarchy.

32. **What is context in React?**
    - The React Context API allows you to share state and data across components without passing props manually at every level.

33. **Practical question: Give an example of context API usage.**
    ```js
    const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
    function App() {
      return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
          <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
      );
    }
    ```

34. **What is the purpose of the callback function as an argument of setState()?**
    - The callback function is executed after the state has been updated, ensuring that you have access to the updated state.

35. **Practical question: Create a custom hook for increment/decrement counter.**
    ```js
    function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
      const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
      const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
      return { count, increment, decrement };
    }
    ```

36. **Which lifecycle hooks in class components are replaced with useEffect in functional components?**
    - `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` are replaced by `useEffect` in functional components.

37. **What is Strict mode in React?**
    - StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It does not render any visible UI but activates additional checks and warnings.

38. **What are the different ways to pass data from a child component to a parent component in React?**
    - You can pass a callback function as a prop to the child and invoke it to send data to the parent.

39. **Practical question: How to send data from child to parent using callback functions?**
    ```js
    function Parent() {
      const handleData = (data) => console.log(data);
      return <Child sendData={handleData} />;
    }
    function Child({ sendData }) {
      return <button onClick={() => sendData('Hello Parent!')}>Send Data</button>;
    }
    ```

40. **Practical question: How to send data from a child component to a parent using useRef?**
    - While refs are generally used for accessing DOM elements, you can pass refs from parent to child using `forwardRef`, and update the parent from the child.
