# 30 React Fundamentals Every Frontend Engineer Should Know

This repository covers the 30 fundamental concepts of React every frontend engineer should be familiar with. Below are questions and answers to essential React concepts with examples and explanations.

## Questions and Answers

1. **How does the virtual DOM work in React, and why is it important?**
   - The Virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the real DOM. React uses the Virtual DOM to optimize UI rendering by only updating the parts of the real DOM that have changed. This makes React applications faster because it reduces costly DOM manipulations.
   - Example: When a state changes, React creates a Virtual DOM, compares it to the previous one, and updates only the differences in the real DOM (reconciliation).

2. **What are React Hooks, and how do they differ from class lifecycle methods?**
   - React Hooks are functions that allow you to use state and other React features in functional components. They simplify managing state, side effects, and component lifecycles without needing class components.
   - Hooks like `useEffect` replace lifecycle methods like `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount`.

3. **Explain the concept of Higher-Order Components (HOCs) and provide use cases.**
   - HOCs are functions that take a component and return a new component with enhanced behavior. They are used to reuse component logic across multiple components.
   - Example: Adding authentication or logging functionality to several components.

4. **What is Context API, and how does it help in managing global state?**
   - Context API is React’s way of managing state globally without passing props down the component tree. It is useful for avoiding prop drilling and managing global state like themes, authentication, or user settings.

5. **How does React's reconciliation algorithm work?**
   - React’s reconciliation algorithm efficiently updates the DOM by comparing the Virtual DOM with the actual DOM. When React detects changes, it updates only the necessary DOM nodes, improving performance.

6. **Describe the concept of "lifting state up" in React and provide an example.**
   - "Lifting state up" means moving shared state to the closest common ancestor component so that multiple components can share the state.
   - Example: When two child components need access to the same data, that state should be lifted up to the parent.

7. **What is the purpose of the useReducer hook, and how does it compare to useState?**
   - `useReducer` is used for managing more complex state logic compared to `useState`. It works similarly to a Redux reducer, taking a reducer function and an initial state and returning the current state and a dispatch function.

8. **How can you optimize the performance of a React application?**
   - Key performance optimizations include:
     - Using React.memo to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
     - Code splitting with `React.lazy` and `Suspense`.
     - Optimizing component rendering with `shouldComponentUpdate` or `React.PureComponent`.

9. **Explain the role of keys in React lists and why they are important.**
   - Keys help React identify which items in a list have changed, been added, or removed. They provide a stable identity for list items, helping React optimize rendering.

10. **What are React Portals, and when should they be used?**
    - React Portals allow you to render children components into a DOM node outside of the parent component. They are often used for modals or tooltips.

11. **Describe the benefits and limitations of server-side rendering (SSR) with Next.js.**
    - **Benefits**: Improved SEO, faster initial load times, better performance on slower devices.
    - **Limitations**: Increased complexity and slower development builds.

12. **How do you implement code splitting in a React application?**
    - Code splitting can be implemented using `React.lazy` and `Suspense`, allowing you to load components lazily when they are needed, reducing the initial load time.

13. **What are custom hooks, and how can they help in reusing logic across components?**
    - Custom hooks are functions that allow you to reuse stateful logic across multiple components. They are useful for abstracting complex logic, making your code more modular and reusable.

14. **Explain the concept of controlled and uncontrolled components in form handling.**
    - **Controlled components**: Form inputs where the state is managed by React using `useState` or `useReducer`. Changes to input are handled by updating the state.
    - **Uncontrolled components**: Form inputs where the state is managed by the DOM using `refs` to access the current value.

15. **How can you manage side effects in a React application?**
    - Side effects like data fetching or DOM manipulation are managed using the `useEffect` hook. It allows you to specify functions that run after the component renders or updates.

16. **Discuss the trade-offs between using Redux and the Context API for state management.**
    - **Context API**: Suitable for small applications or light state sharing. It is simple and avoids boilerplate.
    - **Redux**: Suitable for large applications with complex state logic. Redux offers better debugging tools and centralized state management but requires more setup.

17. **What are fragments in React, and when should they be used?**
    - Fragments let you group multiple elements without adding extra nodes to the DOM. They are used when you need to return multiple sibling elements without wrapping them in a parent element.

18. **How does React handle events differently from vanilla JavaScript?**
    - React uses synthetic events, a cross-browser wrapper around native events. It normalizes event handling across browsers and improves performance by using event delegation.

19. **Describe the use case and implementation of suspense and lazy loading in React.**
    - Suspense and lazy loading are used for code splitting and loading components only when needed.
    - Example: `React.lazy` can dynamically import components and load them when needed.

20. **How can you use React.memo to optimize component rendering?**
    - `React.memo` prevents unnecessary re-renders of functional components by memoizing the output. If the props don't change, the component will not re-render.

21. **What are the common pitfalls of using useEffect, and how can they be avoided?**
    - Common pitfalls include missing dependencies and unintended re-renders. Avoid these by providing all necessary dependencies in the dependency array and using clean-up functions when needed.

22. **How do you handle errors in React components, and what are error boundaries?**
    - Error boundaries are components that catch JavaScript errors in their child components, logging them and displaying a fallback UI.
    - Example: `componentDidCatch` lifecycle method is used to handle errors.

23. **Explain the difference between optimistic and pessimistic updates in React.**
    - **Optimistic updates**: Assume the update will succeed and immediately update the UI.
    - **Pessimistic updates**: Wait for a response from the server before updating the UI.

24. **What is PropTypes, and how does it contribute to type checking in React?**
    - `PropTypes` is a built-in type-checking library in React that validates the props passed to a component, ensuring they are the correct type and shape.

25. **How can you implement dark mode in a React application?**
    - Dark mode can be implemented using state to toggle themes and applying the corresponding CSS styles for light and dark modes.

26. **Describe the role and benefits of using a CSS-in-JS library with React.**
    - CSS-in-JS libraries allow you to style components using JavaScript. They provide scoped styles, dynamic theming, and easier maintenance of component styles.

27. **What are the differences between useRef and createRef?**
    - `useRef` is used in functional components to persist a mutable object between renders, while `createRef` is used in class components to hold references.

28. **How can you handle data fetching in a React component?**
    - Data fetching is handled with `useEffect` to trigger API calls after component mount, using tools like Axios or the Fetch API.

29. **What are the best practices for structuring a React project?**
    - Best practices include organizing files by feature, using folder structures like `/components`, `/services`, and `/hooks`, and ensuring modularity with reusable components.

30. **How do you manage complex animations in React, and which libraries can be used?**
    - Complex animations can be managed using libraries like `Framer Motion`, `React Spring`, or `GSAP`. These libraries provide APIs to create fluid, performant animations.

# React Interview Questions and Answers

This README file contains a comprehensive set of interview questions and answers covering ReactJS concepts across different levels, from basic to expert. Each question is provided with detailed explanations and examples to help you understand and prepare for React interviews.

## **Level 1: Basic Questions**

1. **What is ReactJS and How does it Work?**
   - **ReactJS** is a JavaScript library used for building user interfaces, primarily for single-page applications. It allows developers to create reusable UI components, each managing its own state. React works by maintaining a virtual DOM, which represents the actual DOM. When changes are made to the state, React updates the virtual DOM, compares it to the real DOM, and only updates the parts that have changed (reconciliation).
   - **How it works**: React components return JSX, which is then transformed into JavaScript calls to create DOM elements.
   ```js
   function Welcome(props) {
     return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
   }
   ```

2. **What is the difference between Shadow DOM and Virtual DOM? Explain the reconciliation process.**
   - **Shadow DOM** is a DOM subtree that is isolated from the main DOM, used in Web Components to encapsulate styles and markup. It prevents style leakage.
   - **Virtual DOM** is a concept in React where a lightweight copy of the real DOM is maintained. React performs a reconciliation process, where it compares the new virtual DOM with the previous virtual DOM and updates the real DOM with only the differences.
   - **Reconciliation**: React’s reconciliation algorithm compares the new virtual DOM with the previous one and updates the actual DOM in the most efficient way.

3. **What is the difference between an Element and a Component?**
   - **Element**: React elements are the building blocks of React apps. They describe what you want to see on the screen and are immutable.
   - **Component**: Components are reusable blocks of code that return elements. Components can be class-based or functional, and they can manage their own state.

4. **What is state and props in ReactJS?**
   - **State**: State is a built-in object that stores property values that belong to a component. It is used to keep track of changes within a component.
   - **Props**: Props (short for "properties") are read-only attributes that are passed down from parent to child components. They allow data to flow between components.

5. **What are Pure Components and React.memo()?**
   - **Pure Components**: Pure components in React only re-render when their props or state changes, optimizing performance by avoiding unnecessary renders.
   - **React.memo()**: This is a higher-order component that memoizes a functional component, preventing it from re-rendering if its props haven’t changed.

6. **What are synthetic events in React?**
   - **Synthetic events** are cross-browser wrappers around the browser's native events in React. They provide a consistent interface for handling events like clicks and key presses, making event handling more predictable.

7. **What are the different phases of the component lifecycle?**
   - **Mounting**: The component is created and added to the DOM. Methods: `constructor()`, `componentDidMount()`.
   - **Updating**: The component is re-rendered due to changes in props or state. Methods: `componentDidUpdate()`.
   - **Unmounting**: The component is removed from the DOM. Methods: `componentWillUnmount()`.

8. **What are Higher-Order Components (HOCs)?**
   - **Higher-Order Components (HOCs)** are functions that take a component and return a new component with additional functionality. HOCs are used to reuse logic between components.
   ```js
   function withLogging(WrappedComponent) {
     return function(props) {
       console.log('Component rendered');
       return <WrappedComponent {...props} />;
     }
   }
   ```

9. **What is context and useContext Hook?**
   - **Context**: Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props manually at every level.
   - **useContext Hook**: It is a hook that allows functional components to consume context values.
   ```js
   const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
   function App() {
     const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
     return <div className={theme}>Hello World</div>;
   }
   ```

10. **What are stateless and stateful components?**
   - **Stateless components**: Also known as functional components, these components do not manage their own state. They receive data via props and render UI based on that data.
   - **Stateful components**: Also known as class components or functional components with hooks, these components maintain and manage their own state.

19. **What are refs in React?**
    - Refs are used to access DOM elements directly and bypass React’s re-rendering process.

20. **What is meant by forward ref?**
    - Forward refs allow passing refs through a component to a child component.

21. **What are Error boundaries?**
    - Error boundaries catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree and display a fallback UI instead of crashing the whole application.

22. **What are Higher-order components in React?**
    - A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOCs are used to reuse component logic.

23. **What are the differences between controlled and uncontrolled components?**
    - **Controlled components**: Components where form data is handled by the component’s state.
    - **Uncontrolled components**: Form data is handled by the DOM itself.

24. **What is useCallback?**
    - `useCallback` is a hook that returns a memoized version of a callback function. It helps avoid recreating the same function during re-renders.

25. **What are the differences between useMemo and useCallback?**
    - `useMemo` memoizes a computed value, whereas `useCallback` memoizes a function.

26. **What are keys in React?**

    - `useReducer` is a hook used for complex state logic in components. It returns the current state and a dispatch method.

31. **What are Portals in React?**
    - Portals allow rendering a component’s children into a DOM node outside of the parent component’s DOM hierarchy.

32. **What is context in React?**
    - The React Context API allows you to share state and data across components without passing props manually at every level.

33. **Practical question: Give an example of context API usage.**
    ```js
    const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
    function App() {
      return (
        <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
          <Toolbar />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
      );
    }
    ```

34. **What is the purpose of the callback function as an argument of setState()?**
    - The callback function is executed after the state has been updated, ensuring that you have access to the updated state.

35. **Practical question: Create a custom hook for increment/decrement counter.**
    ```js
    function useCounter(initialValue = 0) {
      const [count, setCount] = useState(initialValue);
      const increment = () => setCount(count + 1);
      const decrement = () => setCount(count - 1);
      return { count, increment, decrement };
    }
    ```

36. **Which lifecycle hooks in class components are replaced with useEffect in functional components?**
    - `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` are replaced by `useEffect` in functional components.

37. **What is Strict mode in React?**
    - StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. It does not render any visible UI but activates additional checks and warnings.

38. **What are the different ways to pass data from a child component to a parent component in React?**
    - You can pass a callback function as a prop to the child and invoke it to send data to the parent.

39. **Practical question: How to send data from child to parent using callback functions?**
    ```js
    function Parent() {
      const handleData = (data) => console.log(data);
      return <Child sendData={handleData} />;
    }
    function Child({ sendData }) {
      return <button onClick={() => sendData('Hello Parent!')}>Send Data</button>;
    }
    ```

40. **Practical question: How to send data from a child component to a parent using useRef?**
    - While refs are generally used for accessing DOM elements, you can pass refs from parent to child using `forwardRef`, and update the parent from the child.
