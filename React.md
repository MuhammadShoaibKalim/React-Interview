# React Interview Questions and Answers

**1. What is React?**
   
React is an open-source front-end JavaScript library most popular for single-page web applications. It helps in building interactive and complex UIs for websites or mobile apps. React.js was released for use in 2013 and has since become one of the most trusted and widely used technologies. It has built one of the largest developer communities around itself.

**2. List some of React.js’ features.**

Important features of React.js include:

**Virtual DOM:** 
React uses a virtual DOM instead of a real DOM to optimize rendering.

**Server-side Rendering:** 
React can render HTML files on the server, improving performance.

**Unidirectional Data Flow:** 
Data flows in one direction, making the application easier to understand and debug.

**JSX:** 
JavaScript XML, a syntax extension for JavaScript, allows writing HTML structures within JavaScript code.

**Component-Based Architecture:** 
UI is divided into reusable components.

**3. What are the main advantages of React.js?**

The main advantages of React.js are:

**Performance**: 
React enhances application performance by using a virtual DOM.

**Flexibility**: 
It can be used on both client-side and server-side.

**Readability**: 
JSX improves the readability of code.

**Integration**: 
React can be easily integrated with frameworks like Angular and Meteor.

**Testing**: 
Writing UI test cases is easier with React.

**4. What is JSX?**

JSX is a syntax extension for JavaScript in React.js. With JSX, it is easy to define how the user interface should look. It allows you to write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code. 
For example:
```
const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>;
```
**5. Describe an event in React.js.**

In React.js, events are actions triggered by user interactions or system-generated actions. For example, clicking a button, pressing a key, or loading a page. In React, event handling is slightly different from plain HTML:

-> Events are named using camelCase instead of lowercase.

-> You pass a function as the event handler instead of a string.

**Example:**
```
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```
**6. How do Lists work in React.js?**

Lists in React.js are created similarly to how they are in regular JavaScript. They are useful for displaying data in an orderly manner, such as menus. To traverse lists, the map() function is used.
**For example:**
```
const numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10];
const multiplyNums = numbers.map(number => number * 5);
console.log(multiplyNums); // Output: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
```
**7. Why are keys used in React.js Lists?**

Keys are used in React.js lists to help identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys make it easier for React to update the UI efficiently by determining which items need to be re-rendered.

**8. Is HTML used in React?**

No, React uses JSX (JavaScript XML) instead of regular HTML. JSX converts HTML tags into React elements.

**9. What is the release date of React?**

React was released in March 2013.

**10. Can you tell two downsides of React?**

Two downsides of React are:

**Integration with MVC Frameworks:** 
It can be difficult to integrate React with MVC frameworks like Rails.

**Learning Curve:**
Developers need to learn how to integrate user interfaces into MVC frameworks.

**11. Can web browsers read JSX directly?**

No, web browsers cannot read JSX directly. Browsers can only read regular JavaScript objects. JSX needs to be transformed into regular JavaScript objects using tools like Babel.

**12. What is an event in React?**

An event is an action triggered by a user or system, such as a key press or a mouse click. React events are named using camelCase, and with JSX, you pass a function as the event handler. For example:
```
<button onClick={handleClick}>Click me</button>
```
**13. What is a state in React?**

State is a built-in React object used to store data or information about the component. The state can change over time, and whenever it changes, the component re-renders. State changes in response to user actions or system-generated events.

**14. What is a higher-order component in React?**

A higher-order component (HOC) is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. HOCs are used to add functionality to existing components in a reusable way. They help keep components simple and enable reusability.
For example:
```
const withLogger = WrappedComponent => {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidMount() {
      console.log('Component mounted');
    }
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
};
```
**15. Explain the ‘Store’ feature.**

The store is a feature of Redux, a state management library for React, that allows the application to save the entire state in one place. This enables you to get regular updates from the store directly and manage the state more efficiently.

**16. What is the Virtual DOM, and how does it work in React?**

The Virtual DOM is a lightweight, in-memory representation of the real DOM. When a component's state or props change, React creates a new Virtual DOM tree, calculates the differences between the new and old trees, and efficiently updates the real DOM to match the new tree.

**17. What are props in React?**

Props (short for properties) are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component. They allow data to flow from one component to another.
For example:
```
function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
```
**18. What is the difference between state and props?**

State: State is a built-in object that holds data about the component. It is mutable and managed within the component.
Props: Props are read-only attributes passed from a parent component to a child component. They are immutable and used to pass data and event handlers down the component tree.

**19. What are React lifecycle methods?**

Lifecycle methods are special methods in React components that are called at different stages of a component's life. Some of the important lifecycle methods are:

-> componentDidMount(): Called after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).
-> componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState): Called after the component is updated.
-> componentWillUnmount(): Called before the component is unmounted (removed from the DOM).

**20. What is Redux, and why would you use it with React?**

Redux is a state management library for JavaScript applications. It helps manage the state of an application predictably. Redux is used with React to manage complex state logic, share state across components, and make state changes easier to debug.

**21. What is the context API in React?**

The Context API is a feature in React that allows components to share data without having to pass props down through multiple levels of the component tree. It is useful for managing global state, themes, user information, and more.

For example:
```
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');

function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Toolbar() {
  return <ThemedButton />;
}

function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = React.useContext(ThemeContext);
  return <button className={theme}>Button</button>;
}
```
**22. What are React hooks?**

Hooks are functions that let you use state and other React features in functional components. Some commonly used hooks are:

useState(): Manages state in a functional component.
useEffect(): Performs side effects in functional components.
useContext(): Consumes a context value.
useReducer(): Manages state using a reducer function.

**23. How does the useEffect hook work?**

The useEffect hook allows you to perform side effects in functional components. It runs after the component renders and can return a cleanup function to run before the component unmounts or before the effect runs again. For example:
```
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
    return () => {
      console.log('Cleanup');
    };
  }, [count]);

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
}
```
**24. What is the difference between controlled and uncontrolled components in React?**

Controlled Components: In controlled components, form data is handled by the React component's state. The value of the input is controlled by the state.
Uncontrolled Components: In uncontrolled components, form data is handled by the DOM itself. Refs are used to access the form values.
Example of a controlled component:
```
class ControlledComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { value: '' };
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({ value: event.target.value });
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
    );
  }
}
```
Example of a uncontrolled component:

```
class UncontrolledComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.inputRef.current.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <input type="text" ref={this.inputRef} />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```
**25. What is a React Router?**

React Router is a standard library for routing in React applications. It enables navigation between different views or pages in a React application, allows changing the browser URL, and keeps the UI in sync with the URL. For example:
```
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch } from 'react-router-dom';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Switch>
        <Route path="/about">
          <About />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/users">
          <Users />
        </Route>
        <Route path="/">
          <Home />
        </Route>
      </Switch>
    </Router>
  );
}
```
**26. What is code-splitting in React?**

Code-splitting is a technique used to split the code into smaller bundles that can be loaded on demand. It helps improve the performance of React applications by reducing the initial load time. React supports code-splitting via dynamic import() and React.lazy().
For example:
```
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <OtherComponent />
    </Suspense>
  );
}
```
**27. What is the significance of key in React?**

The key attribute is used in React to identify which items in a list are changed, added, or removed. It helps React optimize rendering by determining which elements need to be re-rendered. Keys should be unique among siblings.

**28. How can you optimize performance in a React application?**

Some ways to optimize performance in a React application include:

Using the Production Build: Ensure that the production build is used in production.
Code-Splitting: Split code into smaller bundles to load them on demand.
Memoization: Use React.memo() to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
useCallback and useMemo: Optimize functions and values that change frequently.
Lazy Loading: Load components lazily to reduce the initial load time.
Avoid Inline Functions: Define functions outside render methods to avoid re-creation on each render.

**29. What are synthetic events in React?**

Synthetic events are React's cross-browser wrapper around the browser's native event system. They provide a consistent interface for handling events across different browsers. Synthetic events are used to handle events in a platform-agnostic way.

**30. How do you handle forms in React?**

Forms in React can be handled using controlled components, where the form data is controlled by the component's state, or uncontrolled components, where the form data is controlled by the DOM. For example, handling forms using controlled components:
```
class Form extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { value: '' };
  }

  handleChange = (event) => {
    this.setState({ value: event.target.value });
  };

  handleSubmit = (event) => {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  };

  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
```
